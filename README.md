## Problem Statement
<br/>
<blockquote align='center'>  
<h3> “In Korea, about 7 million people have people with borderline intelligence” </h3>
</blockquote>
<br/>

Rossetta is trying to solve various problems facing 7 million people in the estimated population of Borderline Intelligence in Korea. Adults with border intelligence have great difficulties in social life. In particular, there is a lack of institutional support and most of the education and support services are concentrated in the metropolitan area, so the **regional imbalance** is serious. This makes it very difficult for people with borderline intelligence and disabilities living in rural areas to receive education and support services.

In addition, while it is very important for children with border intelligence to receive effective early treatment and education, the cost of education for this is very high, at more than W10 million per year, which is **economic burden***. It is one of the main obstacles preventing many families from getting the education and support they need.

Our service is focused on recognizing these issues and helping children with borderline intelligence and families overcome barriers to economic and accessibility issues. Through this, we want to build a **more comprehensive and accessible education system** and help children with borderline intelligence reach their full potential.


## 🎯  &nbsp;UN's Sustainable Development Goals & Targets

### Goal 4: Quality Education (Target: 4.2)

Rossetta helps early child development to prepare for **primary education**.

We provide customized online learning programs for children with borderline intelligence so that they can develop their cognitive, spatial, and linguistic abilities comprehensively. These educational programs help children have the basic necessary preparations for primary education so that every child has the opportunity to reach their full potential through education.

### Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities

Rossetta's learning service allows all children, regardless of their geographic location, to access educational resources. It provides important opportunities, especially for children living outside of the Seoul metropolitan area.

Our services reduce the financial burden, making it easy to provide to children from more families. This reduces the **economic gap** by allowing children from low-income families to also benefit from education.

Through Rossetta's learning service, we will help children with borderline intelligence improve their intellectual abilities in a variety of ways, including cognition, language, and visual perception, through customized education. This will lay the groundwork for them to actively participate in various areas of society **reduce regional and economic inequality**.
